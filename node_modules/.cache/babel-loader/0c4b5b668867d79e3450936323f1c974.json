The graph will\n * contain all base and subgraph nodes from the request layer in their original\n * hierarchy and any edges that are incident on these nodes and are of the type\n * requested by the \"relationship\" parameter.\n *\n * Nodes from the requested rank that do not have parents are assigned a root\n * node in the output graph, which is set in the root graph attribute. This\n * makes it easy to walk the hierarchy of movable nodes during ordering.\n *\n * Pre-conditions:\n *\n *    1. Input graph is a DAG\n *    2. Base nodes in the input graph have a rank attribute\n *    3. Subgraph nodes in the input graph has minRank and maxRank attributes\n *    4. Edges have an assigned weight\n *\n * Post-conditions:\n *\n *    1. Output graph has all nodes in the movable rank with preserved\n *       hierarchy.\n *    2. Root nodes in the movable layer are made children of the node\n *       indicated by the root attribute of the graph.\n *    3. Non-movable nodes incident on movable nodes, selected by the\n *       relationship parameter, are included in the graph (without hierarchy).\n *    4. Edges incident on movable nodes, selected by the relationship\n *       parameter, are added to the output graph.\n *    5. The weights for copied edges are aggregated as need, since the output\n *       graph is not a multi-graph.\n */\n\nvar buildLayerGraph = function buildLayerGraph(g, rank, relationship) {\n  var root = createRootNode(g);\n  var result = new Graph({\n    compound: true\n  }).setGraph({\n    root: root\n  }).setDefaultNodeLabel(function (v) {\n    return g.node(v);\n  });\n  g.nodes().forEach(function (v) {\n    var node = g.node(v);\n    var parent = g.parent(v);\n\n    if (node.rank === rank || node.minRank <= rank && rank <= node.maxRank) {\n      result.setNode(v);\n      result.setParent(v, parent || root); // This assumes we have only short edges!\n\n      g[relationship](v).forEach(function (e) {\n        var u = e.v === v ? e.w : e.v;\n        var edge = result.edge(u, v);\n        var weight = edge !== undefined ? edge.weight : 0;\n        result.setEdge(u, v, {\n          weight: g.edge(e).weight + weight\n        });\n      });\n\n      if (node.hasOwnProperty(\"minRank\")) {\n        result.setNode(v, {\n          borderLeft: node.borderLeft[rank],\n          borderRight: node.borderRight[rank]\n        });\n      }\n    }\n  });\n  return result;\n};\n\nvar createRootNode = function createRootNode(g) {\n  var v;\n\n  while (g.hasNode(v = \"_root\".concat(Math.random()))) {\n    ;\n  }\n\n  return v;\n};\n\nexport default buildLayerGraph;","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
